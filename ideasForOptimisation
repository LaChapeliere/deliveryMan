For the choice of the next package:
	-taking into account the delivery point?
	-taking the manhattan distance as the cost from one node to another, make a layered directed graph with the pick-ups/delivery nodes, which pick-up having edges incoming from all the delivery points and only one outgoing edge (to its corresponding delivery point). Source has the current distance to each pick-up point. Well only accessible when all pickups and deliveries have been visited
	-

For the A* heuristic:
	-
	
Others:
	-If very bad configuration, wait (threshold?)
	-If best path goes further away form the goal (tolerance for 1 or 2 moves further?), wait
